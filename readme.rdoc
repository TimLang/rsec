== Parser / Regexp Combinator for Ruby. 

Easier and faster than treetop / rex+racc.

It's ruby1.9 only.

As Ruby's

== Install 

The pure Ruby gem is fast enough (about 10+x faster than treetop generated code):

    gem in rsec

For extreme performance under C Ruby:

	gem in rsec-ext

It is about 30% faster than Haskell Parsec in the benchmark.
